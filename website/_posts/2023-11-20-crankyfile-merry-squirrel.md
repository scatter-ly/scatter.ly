Crankyfiles are what the Scatter.ly team calls the note file where you put the things that make you curse. It started because sometimes it's just too obnoxious to have to go look something up for the umpteenth time or keep asking a question. We've asked the team to share some of theirs. Here's what Meridith Squirrel had to say.

Things that make me cranky, an incomplete list:

- Time zones
- Poorly-defined tasks that actually have exact outcomes
- Three-letter acronyms specific to a certain company
- No one understanding the difference between a concordance and an index
