When we told Dave we were gathering crankyfile entries, he said "I have too many!" â€” so rest assured, this is just a start. We all know the feeling.

- Go's inconsistency of using `*` for pointers to structs but not using it for pointers to interfaces
- The lack of a pragmatic integrated frontend/backend/queue authorization framework
- I found a OSS project I needed in a newsletter on Wednesday just after I deployed a half-assed implementation of the bits I needed on Monday.

What a week!
