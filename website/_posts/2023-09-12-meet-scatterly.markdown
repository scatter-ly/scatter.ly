Scatter.ly is the fictional company OpenContext created to walk through how to solve problems with our app. The team is made up of three groups:

- Team Raccoon: long-timers with a healthy amount of tech debt. They have a tendency to just throw things in a bucket and hope for the best.
- Team Squirrel: these upstarts are determined to do things the right way from the beginning and use all the best practices. They have a fondness for spreadsheets.
- Crow Contractors, LLC: this consulting team is there to step in when the squirrels and raccoons need another set of hands. They're effective, but their billing rate is steep so both teams would like to use them only when necessary.
