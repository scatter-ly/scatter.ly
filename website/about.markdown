Welcome! You may have found this site as part of getting to know [OpenContext](https://opencontext.com) and trying [our beta](https://portal.app.opencontext.com/landing) out. In the demo we walk you through how to solve problems with a fictional company that has some familiar issues to work through.

Scatter.ly, a five-year-old company, looks like this:

- They have two teams: Team Squirrel and Team Raccoon
- Team Raccoon is the long-timer team struggling with tech debt
- The Squirrel Team is a newer group trying to do things the right way

In [our user journey](https://docs.opencontext.com/docs/user-journey/part1), we'll take a look at Scatter.ly's original product. By doing this, we can see how deeply integrated their code is to the entire Scatter.ly technical stack. This will help us walk through a few problems in order to see how you can use OpenContext to solve some of these same problems at your own company.
